- Mirror - repeat the last couple of words
- Slow it down, take a breath
- Three tones of voice
- The Late Night DJ voice
- Positive / platful - default 
- Direct / assertive and used sparingly
- "I’m sorry, but I just can’t do that"
- Leave 4 seconds after a mirror
# Chapter 3 - don’t feel their pain
- Empathy and relating to your counterpart immediately shows that you are listening - don’t have to agree with them
- Think about what will break the deal and conduct a deal killer audit (accusation audit) e.g. “Why would you go with a small company that is untested?”
- Label fears - “it seems as though you think it’s risky to use my small firm”, “it seems as though you want to avoid going back to Jail”; even if you’re wrong, using “it” and not “I” gives some distance
# Chapter 4 - Beware Yes
- There are three kinds of yes - beware of all but the sincere version of agreement
- Think of the scumbag tactics of people saying things like “do you like money” or “do you drink water?”, obviously a trap to get you saying yes… Recursive yes’s are deadly
- “No” is underrated - consider “Is now a bad time to talk?” vs. “Do you have a few minutes to talk?”
- Possibly mi-label their emotions or throw out something silly like “it seems like you want this project to fail”
- When ignored, something powerful like “have you given up making this project work?” will illicit a response !
# Chapter 5 - trigger “that’s right”
# Chapter 6 Bend their reality
- Think about the subterranean desires and needs - the Haitian kidnappers wanted money to party on the weekend
- Never split the difference
- Deadlines are good to put in place, but no deal is better than a shitty deal
- Beware of the ultimate f-word, Fair - if used, ask for clarification / explanation as to how you’re not treating or misunderstanding their POV
- Anchoring - “I’m sorry that I can only offer this much, I’m actually embarrased” and then throw out a super low-ball figure, making the ‘real’ one much more reasonable
- Loss aversion - something to lose by inaction
# Chapter 7 Create the illusion of control
- Beware of “yes” or pieces of information - you’re on the hook to reciprocate
- Calibrated questioning - start with “how” or “what” e.g. “how am I supposed to do that?”
- Why is the last thing to ask!
- Get them to expend their energy on solving your problems - how good is that? See calibrated questioning
- When attacked, calibrated question. Delivery is key; cool, calm, collected - think Late night FM DJ
- Think of those behind the table i.e. not at the table
# Chapter 8 Guarantee Execution
- Keep asking those calibrated “hows”
- They’re a good way to imply “no” - “how can i do that?”
- 7/38/55 rule - 7% what you say, 38 how you say it, 55 body language
- Beware of the types of yes’s - counterfeit vs. follow through “yes”; restate it multiple times to make sure you continously get a yes… read the body language
- The more you hear “I” generally means they’re not powerful
- Use your own name, such as “Do oyu have a Mark discount?” or the example with the billigerant person in the bar “Hi, I’m Mark, nice to meet you”
# Chapter 9 Bargain Hard
- Accomodator, Assertive, Analyst
- Prepare, prepare - you always fall back to your highest level of preparation
- Take punches - extreme anchors; if you’re not prepared, you will fall to your maximum straight away
- Ackerman plan - 65,85,95,100, use non-round numbers - $5 127.52 is the best i can do… and I’ll throw in my hat
